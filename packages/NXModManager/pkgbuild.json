        "details": "This is a plugin dedicated to local MOD management and does not provide MOD download functionality.\\nThe installation method is copy-based. Although this is slower than moving files directly, it is designed to facilitate backup and MOD management, so this will never be changed.\\n\\nPlugin Features:\\n\\n- Modern, aesthetically pleasing interface.\\n- Supports multiple languages, automatically following the system language.\\n- Powerful local management features, such as custom names and descriptions.\\n- Supports MTP transfer (experimental), for moving MOD files only.\\n- Allows adding MODs through the plugin or manually.\\n- Supports fast game search."
